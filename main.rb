Reflecting on Principle
1) How are Ruby modules (and similar features from other langs)
   different from a class, in their purpose?
   Modules cann be instantiated. They can serve as namespaces or as "mixins" for behaviors common across objects
2) What is LSP?
Liskov Substitution Principle - a subclass should have all of the behaviors of its superclass 
3) Briefly describe how the template method pattern works.
The superclass has a hook method which can be overridden in the subclass to change (or implement)behavior
